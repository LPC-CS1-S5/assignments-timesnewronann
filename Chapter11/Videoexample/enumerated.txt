Enumerated Data Types:
  a programmer-defined data type.
  Consists of values known as enumerators
  Represent integer constants 

Example:
enum day { MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY };
Identifiers
MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY 
which are listed inside the braces, are enumerators
They Represent the values that belong to the Day data type

enumerators  are not strings
  So they aren't enclosed in quotes
  They are Identifiers

Assigning an integer to an enum Variable
  You cannot directly assign an integer value to an enum variable.
  This will not work

  workDay = 3; // Error!

  You must cast the integer:

  workDay = static_cast<Day>(3);

Using an enum Variable to step through an Array's elements

Remember though:
  You cannot use the ++ operator on an enum variable.
  So the following loop will not work.

Day workDay; // Define a Day variable
//Error!! This code will NOT work.
for (workDay = MONDAY; workDay <= FRIDAY; workDay++)
{
  cout << "Enter the sales for day "
    << workDay << ": ";
    cin >> sales[workDay];
}
