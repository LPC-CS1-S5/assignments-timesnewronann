A union  is almost all regards, just like a structure
The difference is that all the members of a union use the same memory area
  so only one member can be used at a time

A union might be used in an application:
  The program needs to work with two or more values (of different data types)
  but only needs to use one of the values at a time 

Unions conserve memory by storingall their members in the same memory location.
Unions are declared just like structures,
  except the key word union is used instead of struct

      short hours;
      float sales;
  };
