//In this program, we are going to count the occurrence of “th” in the paragraph.  We use the paragraph as follows, which is saved as a file with the name “python.txt”.

//“The Python 2 language was officially discontinued in 2020 (first planned for 2015), and Python 2.7.18 is the last Python 2.7 release and therefore the last Python 2 release. No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it. With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.5.x and later are supported. thither“


//In order to count the number of occurrences of the keyword, we can use any kind of member function from the String class. All occurrences in a word should be counted as separate occurrences. For example, "thither" has two "th" substrings.
