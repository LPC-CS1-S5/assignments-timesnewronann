So basically you want to include all the headers that are useful for math functions

then you want to delcare you variables but you don't need to initialize them yet because when we ask for user input they'll be initialized

Next we make our menu for the user to input their values 

We want to use a switch statement because we are using numbers to make our selection and it allows to make a default for if the user inputs a value that doesn't work

The formulas are pretty self explanatory
