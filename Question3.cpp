/*We are going to check the inclusion relationship between the two arrays. In this program, we need to check that the "numbers1" is a subset of the "numbers2"(no need to check a reverse way). We assume that two arrays "numbers1" and "numbers2" have the sorted order(increasing).

If it is implemented without a nested-loop, you can get the extra points.
tips: Two arrays have already sorted in ascending order.
