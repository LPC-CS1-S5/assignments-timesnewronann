What we learned last week

  Chapter 7 Array.
  - Array Initialization
  - Range-based for loop; vector, class-based
  - Array as function arguments
    (regarded as a pointer)
    int num[5];
    printarray(num); pointer of integer
  -two dimensional arrays 
    one dimensional array of one dimensional array.
    int num[3][5];

    num[1] is the array which has 5 elements of array.
      ; num[1] can be regarded as a pointer (points to one dimensional array)

  - vector
    vector <int> num;
    vector <int> num(10,0); declared as zero 
    vector <int> num(10); will already be initialized as zero
    vector <int> num {1,2,3,4,5};
    num[5] = 20; // causes an error, vectors check the boundary

    compared to array,
    int num[5];
    num[5] = 20; // logical error 

    member functions of vector 
      num.push_back(10); // append 10 
      num.pop_back();
      num.clear();
      num.erase();
      num.sizeof();

      vector<int>:: iterator iter; // will be used in string type

        num.erase(iter);
        num.insert(iter,20) // (iterator, integer value)

      vector<int> number1{15, 2, 315, 1, 50}; // How to traverse the vector
       vector<int>:: iterator iter;

       for (iter = number1.begin(); iter != number1.end; iter++)
       {
       *iter += 10; // pointer
       cout << iter << endl;


  Today's topic

    Chapter 10. Characters /C-String/ String 
      
      Built-in Library Functions for Characters and C-String.
      Member function of String 

      What is the C-String?
        chat name[10]; // character array to store the string
